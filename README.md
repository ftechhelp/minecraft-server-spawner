# minecraft-server-spawner
Deploy any version of minecraft and forge as a container at a mass scale.

This project is made with Python for the backend, [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) and [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) for the frontend. Uses [itzg's docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) through Docker to spawn instances of minecraft or forge based on the parameters provided from the web interface. Web interface gives you an easy way to manage, configure and update the server instances.

The point of this project was to keep everything as light and simple as possible while utilizing python.
